Here you can find **amphp** project logo guidelines and assets.

## License

The logo and the names “Amp” / “amphp” are not covered by the MIT license. They and can only be used by the amphp project on products, websites, and publications.

Under the following conditions, third parties may use the logo as well:

 - You may use the logo in presentations to point to our project.
   Such a presentation must include a link to either amphp.org or github.com/amphp/amp.

 - You will visualize and promote your own branding more prominent than you use our logo.
   Our logo can only be used as secondary brand, which means it has to be clear to an
   average viewer that this is not an official amphp website, publication, or product.

 - You may use the logo for personal fan products, such as stickers, provided you do not
   sell any of these. Sharing these with friends is acceptable.

 - The logo is unaltered, without fancy enhancements, in original colors, original
   typography, and always complete (logo + text). Variants without text as published here
   are complete without text. Use appropriate whitespace around the logo.

 - In case you want to use the logo on products you sell commercially, you always have to
   contact us and ask for explicit permission.

If you have further questions or doubts, do not hesitate to contact us. You can create an issue at [`amphp/logo`](https://github.com/amphp/logo) or write an email to `me@kelunik.com`.
